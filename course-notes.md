# Network Science

## Guiding Questions and Thoughts

"why should I care?" or "why is this important?"

Why do we want to study network science? The first two weeks will focus on this and the following questions:

First, what is a network?

Second, why do we talk about "complex systems" and how are they connected to "networks"?

Third, what kinds of complex systems and networks are around us?

Then, what can we do by studying network science? or why now?

# Networks

## What is a Network?

A set of *vertices* (or nodes) connected by *edges* (or links)

Nodes are individual elements of the system

Edges represent relationships
- stronger relationship: weight
- direction of relationship

system = elements + connections

## What is a Complex System?
(and what is the connection to networks?)

A *complex system* is described as having...
1. many parts
2. complex interactions

Understanding simple individual elements does not allow us to understand the whole system.

A complex system is a system with many parts that are interacting with each other in non-trivial ways.

Networks are about the individual elements (the nodes), and their interactions (the links). The network captures the backbone or structure of complex systems.

**Summary:**

1. We are living in complex systems (society, earth), and we are complex systems (brain, organs, cells)
2. Complex systems: complex interactions of many elements
3. The "structure" of complex systems can often be represented as networks

# Slightly Off-Topic Notes

## On Motivation

> what drives you has profound implications

Three factors lead to better performance and personal satisfaction:
1. Autonomy: the desire to be self directed
  - management is great if you want compliance
  - if you want engagement, self-directed is better
  - one day of autonomy produces things that might never emerge
2. Mastery: the urge to get better at stuff
  - for fun
  - because you get better at something, and that is satisfying
  - challenge + mastery + making a contribution
3. Purpose:

> when the **profit motive** gets unmoored from the **purpose motive**, bad things happen and people don't do good things; you begin to see the following emerge:
> - bad service
> - crappy products
> - uninspiring places to work

*be guided by your inner drive towards learning, mastery, and fun*

## Misconceptions

*as a student*
1. you will have some misconceptions about network science, and if you are not careful, you'll not be able to fix them! Worse, you may simply become more confident about yourself!
2. Don't be afraid to be wrong and pay attention to yourself and be very careful when you get confused. That's the chance that you can learn something new.

ToDo:   
share what kinds of misconceptions you had and how you fixed them!
