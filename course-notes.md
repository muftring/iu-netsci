## On Motivation

> what drives you has profound implications

Three factors lead to better performance and personal satisfaction:
1. Autonomy: the desire to be self directed
  - management is great if you want compliance
  - if you want engagement, self-directed is better
  - one day of autonomy produces things that might never emerge
2. Mastery: the urge to get better at stuff
  - for fun
  - because you get better at something, and that is satisfying
  - challenge + mastery + making a contribution
3. Purpose:

> when the **profit motive** gets unmoored from the **purpose motive**, bad things happen and people don't do good things; you begin to see the following emerge:
> - bad service
> - crappy products
> - uninspiring places to work

*be guided by your inner drive towards learning, mastery, and fun*

## Misconceptions

*as a student*
1. you will have some misconceptions about network science, and if you are not careful, you'll not be able to fix them! Worse, you may simply become more confident about yourself!
2. Don't be afraid to be wrong and pay attention to yourself and be very careful when you get confused. That's the chance that you can learn something new.

ToDo:   
share what kinds of misconceptions you had and how you fixed them!
