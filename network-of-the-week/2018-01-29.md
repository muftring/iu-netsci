The nodes are the content providers and the distributors (i.e., cable TV providers) and internet streaming video services.

The links are directed, and show the percent stake one has in the other.

This network shows some interesting relationships developing between the distributors and providers. The big distributors are either outright buying content provider or investing a stake in one. This is in reaction to companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon making their way into both sides of the market sort, but also remaining "distributor agnostic."

The network is really beginning to move from very disconnected, to a more connected network. In time we should expect more links between nodes.
