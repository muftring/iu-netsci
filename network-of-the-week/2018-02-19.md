**A high-level view of a network structure in finance**

Excerpt from:

> FIG. 1. Schematic overview of the model structure showing the three agent types (banks, firms, and households), and their interactions. Firms pay dividends to their owners, and wages (financed through income and loans) to their workers. Households consume goods produced by the firms. House- holds and firms deposit money in banks, banks grant loans to the firms.

The nodes belong to one of three categories (the paper terms these *agent types*): banks, firms, households.

The links represent the typical interactions between the node types.

From the description provided in the paper, there is a simple set of interactions between the nodes based on type. But, what we can glean from this is that there is a bi-directional dependence between each of the categories. Firms <-> Households: firms pay wages to households, households consume goods from firms. The interaction between Banks and Firms, and Banks and Households (however, not depicted) is the same: deposits are mode to Banks, and Banks lend money.

Further into the paper is a depiction of a banking network. I will perhaps comment on this in a later *Network of The Week* assignment.
