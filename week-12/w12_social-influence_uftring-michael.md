# Prologue
I chose *An Experimental Study of Homophily in the Adoption of Health Behavior* before entering into the Week 13 course material. Looking on Canvas it should be noted that I completed the Week 13 lecture material before completing and submitting this Week 12 assignment. It is difficult, if not impossible, to prevent my analysis from being influenced by the material learned in Week 13. However, I think it acts much more complementary as my original position for An Experimental Study of Homophily was not one of how it fell inline with Shalizi's criticisms, but rather how it seemed to take them head on (perhaps implicitly as Shalizi is not cited) and produced an experiment and study which goes to prove Shalizi correct.

*The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experiment*, by Centola, chronologically precedes An Experimental Study of Homophily. In the concluding video for Week 13, The Spread of Behavior is identified as seminal work in the space of information diffusion, complex contagion, and social networks. I would argue that An Experimental Study of Homophily transitively falls into that category as well, due to the timing and the highly influenced and parallel content. It would be hard to position either paper as subject to Shalizi's criticisms. This is especially true as Centola explicitly calls out designs of the experiments and mechanisms of the study to eliminate conditions which may lead to conflating.

# Summary
(1) summarizes the paper and its experiment,

# Critique
(2) clearly describes how Shalizi's criticisms are relevant to that study,

# Questionable Conclusions
(3) determines what conclusions from the study can be called into question, and

# Modifications
(4) describe how you would change the study in order to address the problematic conclusions/methods. Lastly, assess whether such changes would be practical or not.
