# human organ interaction network

## Networks Around Us
I was searching for "human organ interaction network" and discovered Network Physiology; this seems to be a very newly emerging field. Plamen Ivanov (Boston University) is trying to develop a whole new way of thinking about how the human body works.

"[...] If the research proves fruitful, Ivanov imagines that one day hospital patients will be hooked up to a whole new kind of monitor. Instead of narrowly measuring blood pressure, heart rate, and brain activity, these devices would track the relationships between key organ systems — alerting doctors to cataclysmic phase changes in human health before they occur."

nodes = organs   
links = relationships
