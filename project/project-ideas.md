# human organ interaction network

## Networks Around Us
I was searching for "human organ interaction network" and discovered Network Physiology; this seems to be a very newly emerging field. Plamen Ivanov (Boston University) is trying to develop a whole new way of thinking about how the human body works.

"[...] If the research proves fruitful, Ivanov imagines that one day hospital patients will be hooked up to a whole new kind of monitor. Instead of narrowly measuring blood pressure, heart rate, and brain activity, these devices would track the relationships between key organ systems — alerting doctors to cataclysmic phase changes in human health before they occur."

nodes = organs   
links = relationships

Hi YY,

I am late in submitting the Network Science project proposal; I was not paying close enough attention to the class schedule outside of the weekly modules. (My bad!!) I am hoping to complete and submit the proposal no later than Friday, February 16th.

I have been searching around for ideas since the beginning of class, so I'm not too bad off.. but I need some guidance on choosing a path.

Currently I have two ideas:

(1) perform some analysis on the robustness of the human metabolic network; I found this to be a potentially good starting point: http://www.pnas.org/content/104/6/1777
My approach would be to construct some network models from a data source, analyze the networks, determine the type, form, structure and characteristics, and then attempt to assess the network based on 'failure' and 'attack' (introduced by me).

(2) reproduce one of the works found here: https://www.danisbassett.com/publications.html
This is a research group that is near me (geographically, here in Philadelphia) that I "stumbled" across and whose work I have found very interesting. I might be able to contact them to get access to data, input and assistance, and maybe even arrange to meet them in person for an interview (about the particular research paper / work that I will attempt to reproduce) and even "peer review" my work.

Can you please take a few minutes to review these ideas and give me some feedback, good or bad, and perhaps some additional direction.

Thank you!
Michael Uftring.
