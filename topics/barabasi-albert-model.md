# Barabasi-Albert Model
We must move from describing a network's topology to modeling the evolution of a complex system. Our modeling approach must acknowledge that networks are the product of a steady **growth** process. Most real networks' new nodes prefer to link to more connected nodes, a process called **preferential attachment**.
