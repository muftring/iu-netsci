# Centralities
*Measuring Importance*

## Introduction

- why and when do we want to characterize nodes, links, and other objects in networks?
- what are the key ideas behind network centralities?
- Degree-based centralities:
  - Degree
  - Eigenvector
  - Katz
- Random-walk based centralities: PageRank
- Distance-based centralities: Closeness
- Communication-based centralities: Betweenness

*How can we operationalize 'importance'?*
- degree is just one way
- in many cases degree can become useless
  - social media: following and followers
  - accounts/users/people who simply try to obtain large numbers
  - there is no content
  - concern is on quantity of followers, not quality

**Why?**
- why do we want to measure centralities?
- why do we want to find important nodes or links in a network?

**Basic Ideas**
- what are the fundamental ideas behind these measures?
- often then are really simple ideas
- sometimes those simple ideas can give a lot of information about the network
  - and individual nodes and edges

**How to apply?**
