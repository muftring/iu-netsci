# Network Epidemics
*Spreading Process*

What is *epidemics*? It is from Greek, and translates as:
- epi: upon
- demos: people

*something happening upon people*

An epidemic usually describes infectious disease spreading across the population.

Why do we care?

Studying epidemics helps us understand spreading processes:
- human disease
- computer virus, internet worm
- diffusion of information
- spreading of rumors (e.g., on social media)
- spreading ideas and information

History:
- The Great Plague
- 1918 Spanish Flu
- HIV
- SARS
- H1N1 Flu

This becomes much more dangerous and important because we are getting much more connected.
- high population density (in cities)
- high mobility (air travel)
- <u>equates to</u>: perfect conditions for epidemic spreading

Population density matters (a lot) because it provides the fuel where the infectious disease is the fire.
- small, separate (unconnected) population will burn the "local fuel" and cause the fire to "die out" (think: hunter-gatherer society, wild animals)
- large (highly populated) cities are strongly connected to other cities and so the chance for spread of disease is great (almost perfect)

Mobility matters (also)
- limited by the speed of human travel

Spreading always means Connections
- network structure plays important role in any spreading process
- for disease, and for information
- copy without loss
