# Social Influence
Spreading: fundamental dynamics
- behavior
- belief
- information
- rumors
- innovations

*Social psychology*: How people influence each other. How much do we influence each other?

> group conformity<br>

> people will deny what they see, and conform to group behavior (pressure)

**informational conformity** - convinced the group is right

**normative conformity** - apprehension that the group will disapprove to deviancy

Controlled experiments
- empirical studies
- (many studies)
- randomized assignment
- carefully study how we influence each other

It is very difficult to conclude that something is spreading on social network based on observational studies (Cosma Shalizi).

Examples
- Music Lab
- Election

Causes of Similarity and clustering
- induction
- homophily (selection)
- contagion (influence)
- confounding

# social influence through observational study
How can you determine a person's behavior in a social network? Is it due to social influence, homophily or something else? Is it even possible to determine? (The general argument is: probably not.)

- social contagion/influence
- manifest homophily (observable characteristics)
- latent homophily (unobservable characteristics)

The challenge of social research is to determine which mechanism is responsible for a person's behavior.

It is not possible in an observational study.

# Things that look like Spreading
- social contagion/influence
- biological contagion
- manifest homophily (on the observed characteristic of interest)
- secondary homophily (on a different yet observed characteristic)
- latent homophily (on an unobserved characteristic)
- common external causation

some are really difficult to distinguish social contagion from other reasons or other phenomena

some can be controlled using statistical models

# Correlation vs. Causation
if you cannot control, then it is very hard to get to causation

just having observational data makes it very difficult to draw any conclusion on causal effects

# Controlled Experiments
How to draw causality?
- you have a system (or person)
- there is treatment (some intervention)
- observe a state transition occurs in the system

Did the treatment cause the system state change or not? To test this, you need to go back in time and do another treatment (or absence of treatment) and see what happens.

Randomized Experiment
- basic idea
- you have many similar systems (or people)
- randomly assign to groups
- apply a different treatment to each group
- identify whether we get change we expect from certain treatment
- if yes, then it is safe to conclude that "a" influenced the change of the system state and "b" did not

Example:
- clinical trial for drugs
- randomly assign patients into two groups
- one group is given the actual drug
- the other group is given a placebo
- measure how the two groups differ from each other

Key:
- how random is the group assignment
- whether everything else is controlled, making it an equal setting
- in clinical trials, double blind testing is common in order to prevent any small leakage of information and assignment to the patient groups

The same approach is applied for measuring social influence or other network phenomena. We want to do randomized experiments in order to really draw causal conclusion.

# Definitions

**homophily**<br>
from Ancient Greek ὁμοῦ (homou, "together") and Greek φιλία (philia, "friendship") is *the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others*, as in the proverb "birds of a feather flock together".

**contagion** |kənˈtājən|<br>
noun<br>
the communication of disease (*spreading*) from one person to another by close contact: the rooms held no risk of contagion.
- a disease spread by the close contact of one person to another.
- the spreading of a harmful idea or practice: the contagion of disgrace.

**causation** |kôˈzāSHən|<br>
noun<br>
the action of causing something: investigating the role of nitrate in the causation of cancer.<br>
- the relationship between cause and effect; causality.

**confound** |kənˈfound|<br>
verb [ with obj. ]<br>
1. cause *surprise* or confusion in (someone), especially by acting against their expectations: the inflation figure confounded economic analysts.
    - prove (a theory, expectation, or prediction) wrong: the rise in prices confounded expectations.
    - defeat (a plan, aim, or hope): we will confound these tactics by the pressure groups.
    - archaic overthrow (an enemy).
2. (often be confounded with) mix up (something) with something else so that the individual elements become *difficult to distinguish*: 'nuke' is now a cooking technique, as microwave radiation is confounded with nuclear radiation.

**manifest** 1 |ˈmanəˌfest|<br>
adjective<br>
*clear or obvious* to the eye or mind: the system's manifest failings.
verb [ with obj. ]<br>
display or show (a quality or feeling) by one's acts or appearance; demonstrate: Ray manifested signs of severe depression.

**latent** |ˈlātnt|<br>
adjective<br>
(of a quality or state) existing but not yet developed or manifest; *hidden*; *concealed*: discovering her latent talent for diplomacy.
