# Communities

## Introduction
Clustering: your friends tend to know each other, and we form triangles.

In real networks, we form triangle and also larger scale structures called communities.

> Proteins form protein complexes to do certain job. Each complex is a molecular machine that does something.

- How can we define these communities?
- How can we identify them?
- What is the significance of these communities in network science?

### Why do we want to study network communities?
It is a fundamental method and aspect of many networks. Many analysis start with finding communities.

> **k-means clustering**<br>
> k-means clustering is a general data science algorithm.<br>
> Clustering is a basic and fundamental unsupervised learning method that gives useful insight into a data set.<br>
> Usually the communities correspond to some units in the network that bears some significance.
> Functional groups can be identified by structural communities.
> Network communities can serve as really basic analysis, but tend to correspond to important functional units (in bio system) or some important units.
> In social systems, network community often correspond to meaningful groups: data science program, our school, faculty group, etc.

Early ideas:
- <u>graph cuts</u>: with a graph, and a defined flow, which cut can you make which breaks the network into two parts while minimizing the sum of the weights destroyed. How to cut a network into two pieces in a nice way.
- <u>hierarchical clustering</u>: define some measure of similarity between nodes
- <u>betweenness</u>: the br


## Discussion
> **What are the network communities around us?** <p>
> In society, we belong to many social groups. Can you name some of the categories of social groups? For instance, if you are working in a company, everyone in your team should know each other and thus will form a network community. You can also imagine larger groups such as departments also form network communities (you tend to know more people in the same department than other department, etc.). What are the other types of social groups that you participate? <P>
Imagine other networks (e.g. biological, neural, ...). Will they exhibit network communities? Would they have relevance to the function of the whole network? Name some examples of network communities formed in networks other than the social network.
