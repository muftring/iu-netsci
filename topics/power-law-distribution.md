# Power-Law Distribution
Plotting on a log-log scale, the curve will appear as a "straight" line decreasing linearly.

The power-law distribution:

$$p_k \sim k^{-\gamma }$$

The exponent $\gamma$ is its *degree exponent*.

Take the logarithm of this produces:

$$lm\,p_k \,\sim\, -\gamma\,lm\,k$$

$lm\,p_k\,$ is expected to depend linearly on $lm\,k$, meaning the slope of this line beig the degree exponent $\gamma$.

## Zipf's Law
> Zipf's law (/ˈzɪf/) is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions.

It is a discrete form of the continuous Pareto distribution, from which we get the Pareto Principle.

## Pareto Distribution
> The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution that is used in description of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena. Originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population, the Pareto distribution has colloquially become known and referred to as the Pareto principle, or "80-20 rule". This rule states that, for example, 80% of the wealth of a society is held by 20% of its population. However, the Pareto distribution only produces this result for a particular power value,
 $\alpha$. While $\alpha$  is variable, empirical observation has found the 80-20 distribution to fit a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities.

### Pareto Principle
> The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
