# Scale-Free Networks
Why many real networks are very different from Poisson distribution.

Why is it important to have *hubs*?

## Hubs
*Hubs* are highly connected nodes; a node that possesses an exceptionally large number of links is called a hub.

Hubs are not unique the the Web (WWW); they are encountered in most real networks.

### The Largest Hub
<u>Question</u>: How does the network size affect the size of its hubs?

To answer this we calculate the maximum degree, $k_{max}$, called the *natural cutoff* of the degree distribution $p_k$. It represents the expected size of the largest hub in a network.

For a scale-free network the natural cutoff is:

$$k_{max}=k_{min}N^\frac{1}{\gamma^-1}$$

the larger a network, the larger is the degree of its biggest hub

## Scale-Free Property
There is a deeper organizing principle which is representative of *hubs*. We call this the scale-free property. The *degree distribution* of real networks thus becomes very important; it allows us to uncover and characterize scale-free networks.

## Scale-Free Network
<u>Definition</u>: a *Scale-Free Network* is a network whose degree distribution follows a *Power Law*.
