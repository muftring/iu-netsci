# Scale-Free Networks
Why many real networks are very different from Poisson distribution.

Why is it important to have *hubs*?

## Hubs
*Hubs* are highly connected nodes; a node that possesses an exceptionally large number of links is called a hub.

Hubs are not unique the the Web (WWW); they are encountered in most real networks.

## Scale-Free Property
There is a deeper organizing principle which is representative of *hubs*. We call this the scale-free property. The *degree distribution* of real networks thus becomes very important; it allows us to uncover and characterize scale-free networks.

## Scale-Free Network
<u>Definition</u>: a *Scale-Free Network* is a network whose degree distribution follows a *Power Law*.
