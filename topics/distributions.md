## Discussion
In Binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions we expect a certain scale. The tail will taper off very fast, and after a certain point we do not expect anything.

In the case of Power-Law distribution, it is different: the tail does not taper off to zero (within sight, but probably eventually?) and you cannot ignore outliers in the tail. There is also no characteristic scale in the distribution.
